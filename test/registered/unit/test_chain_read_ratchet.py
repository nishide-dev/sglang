"""Nobody reaches the startup record through another object for a resolved value.

The supplied-instance census counts three spellings, all of which start from a
`server_args` parameter -- the caller chose the object, which is the contract
that makes those reads defensible. This pins the fourth: `model_runner.
server_args.field`, `self.scheduler.server_args.field`, `tokenizer_manager.
server_args.field`. A reference lifted off whatever object happened to hold the
record carries no contract at all, and it was invisible to every census, which
is how it grew to 105 reads across 36 files unnoticed.

They are gone, and this is what keeps them gone. Only fields resolution writes
are pinned: reading `model_runner.server_args.host` off the record answers with
what the caller asked for, which is what the record is for. The written set is
derived from the declaration sites rather than listed, so a field that stops
being resolution-written drops out on its own -- and a field that stops being
*declared* cannot slip out that way, because bare assignment during resolution
is refused by `server_args/test_resolution_declarations.py`.
